###  Application Domain

The **application domain** describes what are the (software) components involved and how they interact, collaborate or are coordinated. It also provides an overview of the system architecture.

This may include:
* a description of the components (actors) involved and how they interact, collaborate or are coordinated to realize the xShare button business cases
  * [xShare button sequence diagrams](yb_sequence_diagram.html).
* [Primary logical application components](yb_components) considered in the design of the xShare reference implementation
* Detailed test cases for validating the xShare button.
