#### Patient Empowered by His Data: Using It for a Second Opinion

- **A patient, Tom, opens the hospital's official mobile app to access his medical records.**
- Using a secure two-factor authentication process, Tom logs in to the app, confirming his identity.
- Once authenticated, Tom requests his patient summary.
- The system generates the summary in the **EEHRxF format**, a standardized, machine-interoperable file (CDA or FHIR).
- Tom downloads the summary to his mobile device for personal use.
- The app displays the patient summary in a **user-friendly interface**, enabling Tom to review his medical history, lab results, and prescriptions easily.
- Pleased with the clarity of the information, Tom decides to share it with a new specialist for a second opinion.
- The app provides a **secure sharing option**, but Tom chooses to manually upload the downloaded file via the specialist’s portal.
- With a few taps, Tom successfully completes the file transfer.
- The seamless interaction leaves Tom confident in managing his healthcare data.
- This scenario demonstrates how modern EHR systems empower patients with **access, understanding, and control** over their medical records.

#### Patient Aggregating His Data in a Single Place

- **Similar to the storyline above, Tom is able to access his IPS, download it in an interoperable format (EEHRxF), and use it to his advantage.**
- However, Tom’s IPS is only part of his available health data. Other healthcare providers have created additional records in the past, showing the development of his health.
- By following the process described in the first storyline multiple times across his previous healthcare providers, Tom is able to collect multiple instances of his IPS, creating a comprehensive healthcare timeline.
- By making use of a **Personal Health Record (PHR)**, Tom uploads all instances of his IPS in a standardized format, creating an easily accessible overview of his medical data.
