### xShare Yellow Button Toolbox


The governance of xShare tools and assets is designed to ensure that the developed artifacts are not only technically robust but also accessible for organizations interested in adopting the xShare Yellow Button. 

To facilitate this adoption, all artifacts, while remaining on GitHub to support development, will be linked by the x-bundle registry. 

The registry acts as a comprehensive catalogue of modular components specified within WP2, enhancing accessibility and guiding implementers through the adoption and integration process.

A first list of tools is reported in the [x-Bundle regstry](https://x-bundles.ehr-exchange-format.eu/lab-rpt-tool/tools.html)

#### CDA2FHIR

The [CDA2FHIR Converter](https://github.com/srdc/cda2fhir) is a critical tool developed to address compatibility between the CDA format, currently used in the MyHealth@EU infrastructure, and the HL7 FHIR standard, which is recommended by the EEHRxF for interoperability. 
The CDA2FHIR Converter transforms CDA documents, such as Patient Summaries and ePrescriptions, into FHIR-compliant resources, facilitating cross-border data sharing and ensuring that health information remains accessible and usable across different systems.

#### Smart Health Links

[Smart Health Links](https://docs.smarthealthit.org/smart-health-links/spec/) (SHL) provide a streamlined, secure way to share personal health information through easily accessible links. These links facilitate patient-centred data exchange by allowing individuals to grant access to selected health data securely and efficiently across various healthcare systems and applications. The SHL framework is built on interoperability standards that ensure health information can be shared and accessed consistently across platforms, supporting scenarios from clinical care to personal health management.

#### Git Hub

A GitHub repository ([xShare GitHub](https://github.com/xSHARE-project-eu)) have been established and maintained to support collaborative development and version control for all technical assets related to the technical assets that were developed to support xShare toolbox. These repositories serve as a central hub for code management, issue tracking, and collaborative problem-solving among the involved partners and others, as the reference code is open source and publicly available to the community. 
Regular updates, thorough documentation, and structured branching strategies ensure that all modifications are transparent and traceable. This collaborative environment fosters innovation and ensures that all partners can contribute effectively to developing and maintaining the project's technical components. It also supports the continuity of other projects or endeavours, thereby enhancing these technical assets to improve their functionality and impact.

#### FHIR Validator

FHIR validator is an operation in FHIR that allows you to ensure that a FHIR resource conforms to the base resource requirements or a specified profile.
The [FHIR public validators](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Public+FHIR+Validation+Services) are a set of validators that enable the validation of the FHIR resources using the profiles URLs.

#### EEHRxF Validator

The [HL7 Sandbox](https://sandbox.hl7europe.eu/) provides a set of tools of FHIR validator/conformance for Health Information Domains (in particular Laboratory Results and Electronic Prescriptions).

#### FHIR PDF converter

[FHIR PDF converter](https://github.com/Bahmni/fhir-pdf) enables the creation of a PDF using a FHIR resource.
